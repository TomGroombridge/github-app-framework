## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### Things to think about

1. Can we think about using classes still for the Github API?
2. Can we unit test our classes?
3. Can you show your understanding of the .env file for something?
4. Can we make sure our code is clean?
5. Are we having the happy and unhappy paths?


### Hints

1. Plan what you are going to do before starting
2. Make sure you install the modules your require 
3. If in doubt always look at the documentation
4. If you don't want to reload the app after every change, use 'nodemon'
